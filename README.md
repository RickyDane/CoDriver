<p align="center">
  A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.
  <br>
  It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.
</p>

<br/><br/>

The performance is provided by ["jwalk"](https://crates.io/crates/jwalk/versions) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/).
<br/><br/>
CoDriver does not use path caching to access files and folders, so the performance is achieved by Rust, the speed of the disk and the power of the cpu.

⁉️ Keep in mind that this software is still work in progress and will contain bugs!
