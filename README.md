A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.
<br>
It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.

The performance is provided by ["rust_search"](https://crates.io/crates/rust_search) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/).
<br><br>
rdpFX does not use path caching to access files and folders, so the performance is achieved by Rust, the speed of the disk and the power of the cpu.
