# rdpFX
A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.

It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.

The performance comes from "rust_search".
So high performance is achieved purely by Rust and the speed of the disk, without path caching (which may come later).

### Basic features
:arrow_upper_right: Navigate through directories as you know it
:file_folder: Copy & Paste files and folders
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Delete file and folders
:open_file_folder: Create files and folders

### Advanced features
:postbox: Compress files and folders
:postbox: Unpack archives automatically into a new folder in the working directory
