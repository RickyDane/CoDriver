<p align="center">
  A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.
  <br>
  It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.
</p>

<br/><br/>

The performance is achieved by ["jwalk"](https://crates.io/crates/jwalk/versions) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/).
<br/><br/>
CoDriver does not use path caching to access files and folders, so the performance is achieved by Rust, the speed of the disk and the power of the cpu.

⁉️ Keep in mind that this software is still work in progress and will contain bugs!

## How to contribute
Setup your machine for developing tauri v1 applications: [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
</br></br>
When this is done just do ```git clone https://github.com/RickyDane/CoDriver``` or ```gh repo clone RickyDane/CoDriver``` in a location on your machine.
</br></br>
You should be able to run ```cargo tauri dev``` in the root directory of this project to start building and running CoDriver.
</br>
Be sure to have tauri-cli installed: ```cargo install tauri-cli```
