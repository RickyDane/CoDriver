<p align="center">
  A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.
  <br>
  It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.
</p>

<br/><br/>

The performance is provided by ["jwalk"](https://crates.io/crates/jwalk/versions) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/).
<br/><br/>
CoDriver does not use path caching to access files and folders, so the performance is achieved by Rust, the speed of the disk and the power of the cpu.

‚ÅâÔ∏è Keep in mind that this software is still work in progress and will contain bugs!
