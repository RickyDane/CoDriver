# rdpFX
A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.

It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.

| OS                              |  Support  |
|:--------------------------------|:----------|
| Linux                           | ‚úîÔ∏è        |
| macOS (intel / apple silicon)   | ‚úîÔ∏è        |
| Windows                         | ‚úîÔ∏è        |
| FreeBSD                         | Probably? |
| OpenBSD                         | Probably? |

The performance comes from ["rust_search"](https://crates.io/crates/rust_search) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/)
<br>So high performance is achieved purely by Rust and the speed of the disk, without path caching (which may come later).
