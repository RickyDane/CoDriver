# rdpFX
A simple file explorer that was born because I wanted to learn the Rust language.

It is operating system independent and trimmed for optimization.

| OS      |  Support  |
|:--------|:---------:|
| Linux   | ✔️         |
| macOS   | ✔️         |
| Windows | ✔️         |
| FreeBSD | Probably? |
| OpenBSD | Probably? |

The performance comes from ["rust_search"](https://crates.io/crates/rust_search) and ["Tauri"](https://tauri.app/)
<br>So high performance is achieved purely by Rust and the speed of the disk, without path caching (which may come later).
